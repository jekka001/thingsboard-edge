### Solution description

With a Smart Retail template you get the tool for effective smart supermarket solutions.
You may easily adopt the template to your needs and monitor other types of retail facilities.  
We share this and other templates with you to make the on-boarding faster and simpler.

#### Benefits
No need to develop specific rule chains, set up alarm rules, configure transport, and spend time with multi-layer interactive dashboard development
One-click install and uninstall of the template.

#### Whatâ€™s available?
As the Tenant Administrator you get a dashboard to provision multiple supermarkets.
You will be able to upload floor plan and layout the sensors.

As a Supermarket Administrator you get a dashboard to browse the state of the supermarket.
You may configure and browse alarms for various devices:

* "Smart Shelf" devices generate alarm when shelf weight is below a defined threshold;
* "Chiller" and "Freezer" devices generate alarm when temperature is above the defined threshold;
* "Smart bin" sensor generates alarm when the bin level is above the defined threshold;
* "Reverse Vending Machines" inform if they are low on coins or overloaded with cans;
* "Coffee Vending Machines" inform if they are low on milk or coffee beans;
* "Light" and "Motion" sensors raise alerts if someone is in the store after working hours;
* "Fire Alarm" devices react on smoke and fire;
* "Liquid Level" devices react on low liquid levels in sanitizers and dispensers;

#### How to use?

Use this template with zero changes for PoCs and small projects with straightforward requirements or embed it to more complex Smart Retail solutions.

#### How to connect real devices?

The most popular approach is to use [IoT gateway](https://thingsboard.io/docs/iot-gateway/what-is-iot-gateway/) per supermarket. 
Chillers, freezers and HVAC may be connected using [Modbus](https://thingsboard.io/docs/iot-gateway/config/modbus/), 
[BACnet](https://thingsboard.io/docs/iot-gateway/config/bacnet/) and other supported protocols. 
Alternatively, use your own IoT Gateway and connect it to ThingsBoard using the [MQTT Gateway API](https://thingsboard.io/docs/paas/reference/gateway-mqtt-api/).

You may also connect existing LoRaWAN, NB IoT, SigFox and other sensors through [integrations](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/integrations/).
