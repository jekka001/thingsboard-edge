### Solution description

With a Smart Irrigation template you get the tool for effective field irrigation solutions. 
We share this and other templates with you to make the on-boarding faster and simpler.

#### Benefits

No need to develop specific rule chains, set up alarm rules, and spend time with multi-layer interactive dashboard development
One-click install and uninstall of the template.

#### Whatâ€™s available?

As a Tenant Administrator, you get an "Irrigation Management" dashboard to provision multiple fields and sensors.
The solution is based on three different types of IoT devices listed below:

* "Soil Moisture Sensor" device measures the soil moisture level. Each field may have multiple sensors;
* "Water Meter" reports the water consumption. The logic to stop the irrigation is based on the water con;
* "Smart bin" sensor generates alarm when the bin level is above the defined threshold;
* "Door" and "Motion" sensors raise alerts if someone is in the store after working hours;
* "Smoke Sensor" devices react on smoke and fire;
* "Liquid Level Sensor" devices raise alarms on low liquid levels in sanitizers and soap dispensers;
* "Occupancy Sensor" devices raise alarms on prolonged occupancy of critical rooms;

#### How to use?

Use this template with zero changes for PoCs and small projects with straightforward requirements or embed it to more complex Smart Retail solutions.

#### How to connect real devices?

The most popular approach is to use [IoT gateway](https://thingsboard.io/docs/iot-gateway/what-is-iot-gateway/) per supermarket. 
Chillers, freezers and HVAC may be connected using [Modbus](https://thingsboard.io/docs/iot-gateway/config/modbus/), 
[BACnet](https://thingsboard.io/docs/iot-gateway/config/bacnet/) and other supported protocols. 
Alternatively, use your own IoT Gateway and connect it to ThingsBoard using the [MQTT Gateway API](https://thingsboard.io/docs/paas/reference/gateway-mqtt-api/).

You may also connect existing LoRaWAN, NB IoT, SigFox and other sensors through [integrations](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/integrations/).
