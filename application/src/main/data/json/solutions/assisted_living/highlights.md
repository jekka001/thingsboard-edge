The Assisted Living template represents a solution for monitoring and controlling residents' health, tracking their movement and environment. Alert systems allow you to timely notify service personnel about changes in conditions and respond to them promptly, which significantly facilitates monitoring as a whole and raises the service to a new level.

The interactive map of the resident helps to keep the necessary information always at hand and to monitor its changes.
With the help of sensors reading body metrics, the staff can monitor residents' condition in real-time, receive accurate and reliable data, document it, analyze it and keep statistics. The data, in turn, will help doctors and staff quickly identify potential problems and warn them before they occur.

The system analyzes telemetry from sensors and notifies supervisors about changes in the conditions of stay â€” for example, when someone presses the alarm button or when one of the parameters becomes critical.
