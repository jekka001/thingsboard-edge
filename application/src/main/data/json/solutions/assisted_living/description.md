### Solution description

With an Assisted Living template you get the tool for effective field irrigation solutions. 
We share this and other templates with you to make the on-boarding faster and simpler.

#### Benefits

No need to develop specific rule chains, set up alarm rules, and spend time with multi-layer interactive dashboard development
One-click install and uninstall of the template.

#### Whatâ€™s available?

As a Tenant Administrator, you get an "Irrigation Management" dashboard to provision multiple fields and sensors.
The solution is based on three different types of IoT devices listed below:

* "Soil Moisture Sensor" device measures the soil moisture level. Each field may have multiple sensors;
* "Water Meter" reports the water consumption. The logic to stop the irrigation is based on the water consumption or duration;
* "Smart Valve" allows to stop the irrigation remotely;

#### How to use?

Use this template with zero changes for PoCs and small projects with straightforward requirements or embed it to more complex Smart Irrigation solutions.

#### How to connect real devices?

The most popular approach is to use LoRaWAN devices and gateways or NB IoT. 
You may connect existing LoRaWAN, NB IoT, SigFox and other sensors through [integrations](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/integrations/). 
Alternatively, use your own IoT Gateway and connect it to ThingsBoard using the [MQTT Gateway API](https://thingsboard.io/docs/paas/reference/gateway-mqtt-api/).
