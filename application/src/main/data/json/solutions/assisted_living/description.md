### Solution description

The Assisted Living template is a monitoring system for persons who need it. Connection with a smart wristband allows monitoring and analyzing vital indicators of residents, such as heart rate and temperature. In some cases, individuals can use the bracelet as a panic button, which will send a signal to the alarm system, and the responsible person will be able to respond promptly to the signal.
