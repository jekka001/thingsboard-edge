The Swimming Pool SCADA template provides a comprehensive monitoring and control solution specifically designed for swimming pool operations. 
With this template, you get a feature-rich dashboard, offering real-time device management and intuitive alarm configuration.
SCADA systems are generally divided into two types: Traditional and High-Performance.

Solution automatically configures the IoT gateway, creates an asset and 14 devices.

**Hardware Components**:

* **Sensors**: Water level, temperature (outdoor, pool), flow rate, vibration, and pressure sensors.
* **Actuators**: Valves and switches for managing the filtration system, heat pump states, and flow control in pump segments.

**Software Components**:

* **IoT Gateway**: Utilizes ModBus protocol to communicate with physical devices.
* **Device Emulators**: Docker images that simulate real device responses for testing and demonstration.
* **SCADA Dashboard**: Customizable dashboard for real-time data visualization and control.
