The SCADA Drilling System template provides a comprehensive monitoring and control solution tailored for drilling operations.
This template includes a feature-rich dashboard for real-time device management, drilling performance tracking, and intuitive alarm configuration.

Solution automatically configures the IoT gateway and creates five essential drilling devices.

**Hardware Components**:

* **Drill Bit Sensors**: Monitors torque, speed, and wear to optimize drilling efficiency and prevent failures.
* **Drawwork System**: Controls hoisting operations, ensuring smooth handling of the drill string and minimizing mechanical stress.
* **Drilling Mud Sensors**: Tracks mud circulation parameters, including pressure, flow rate, and viscosity, to maintain borehole stability.
* **Drilling Rig Monitoring**: Provides real-time data on rig structure, vibrations, load distribution, and energy consumption.
* **Blowout Preventer (BOP) Control**: Ensures well safety by monitoring pressure levels and enabling remote activation of the preventer system.

**Software Components**:

* **IoT Gateway**: Utilizes the ModBus protocol to communicate with physical drilling equipment.
* **Device Emulators**: Docker images that simulate real device responses for testing and demonstration.
* **SCADA Dashboard**: A customizable interface for real-time data visualization, control, and alarm notifications.
