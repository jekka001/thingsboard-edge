### Solution description

The Air Quality Monitoring template is a pollution monitoring service in cities that can be part of a Smart City. AQI Monitoring allows you to monitor the level of air pollution online.

The average value of all air pollution control devices will be determined for the city.


The AQI is defined as the highest value calculated for each pollutant as follows:
- Identify the highest concentration among all of the monitors within each reporting area:
    - Ozone (ppm)
    - PM2.5 (µg/m3 )
    - PM10 (µg/m3 )
    - CO (ppm)
    - SO2 (ppb)
    - NO2 (ppb)
- Define two breakpoints that contain the concentration for the AQI which are required to apply the correct values to calculate the formula.
- Calculate the index based on the formula determination of AQI.

Once the index is defined, the system will display the corresponding legend, color, and recommendations.

#### Benefits

A ready-made solution for your needs with all the configured conditions for your devices, which can also be part of a Smart City solution.

#### What’s available?

An accessible dashboard for the end user: all devices are displayed on an interactive map in a user-friendly interface. AQI is displayed with recommendations for sensitive groups of people.
A dashboard of management devices is available, as well as a widget with basic alerts that respond to a certain change in environmental conditions.

#### How to use?

As part of the Smart City use case. Controlling air pollution and AQI is important for a favorable city ecology. It will help identify and apply tools to improve the ecology of city districts and the city as a whole, as well as inform people about the safety of being outside.
