The AIR Quality Monitoring template represents a solution for general air pollution monitoring and provides general recommendations in a user-friendly manner. The main metric for controlling the level of air pollution is AQI. 

AQI is calculated based on Ozone, PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2 and NO2 sensor readings. Solution supports sensors that report all or limited number of the readings.

Also, when installing this solution, the possibility of managing air quality control sensors will be provided.
