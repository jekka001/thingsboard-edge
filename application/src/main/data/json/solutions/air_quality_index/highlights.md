The AIR Quality Monitoring template represents a solution for general air pollution monitoring and provides general recommendations in a user-friendly manner. The main metric for controlling the level of air pollution is AQI.

In our specific solution, we base it on the US AQI. If you want to use a specific value, we can configure them exclusively according to your requirements. Please contact us for more information.

Also, when installing this solution, the possibility of managing air quality control devices will be provided.
