The waste monitoring system template represents a general waste monitoring solution that can be a part of a Smart City.

Waste monitoring solutions are an integral part of smart cities. By implementing technology and data analytics to manage waste collection and disposal processes, cities can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and promote sustainability.

Smart waste management systems utilize sensors and other monitoring devices to collect real-time data on waste levels, collection frequency, and other metrics. This data is then analyzed to optimize waste collection routes, reduce collection frequency, and improve waste disposal processes. Overall, waste monitoring solutions play a vital role in creating more sustainable and livable cities.
