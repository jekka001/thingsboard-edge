# ThingsBoard Edge single docker images 

This project provides the build for the ThingsBoard Edge single docker images.

* `thingsboard/tb-edge` - single instance of ThingsBoard Edge with PostgreSQL database.

## Running

Create docker compose file for ThingsBoard Edge service:
```
sudo nano docker-compose.yml
```

Add the following lines to the yml file:

```
version: '2.2'

services:
  mytbedge:
    restart: always
    image: "thingsboard/tb-edge:2.6.0"
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "1883:1883"
      - "5683:5683/udp"
    environment:
      CLOUD_ROUTING_KEY: PUT_YOUR_EDGE_KEY_HERE # e.g. 19ea7ee8-5e6d-e642-4f32-05440a529015
      CLOUD_ROUTING_SECRET: PUT_YOUR_EDGE_SECRET_HERE # e.g. bztvkvfqsye7omv9uxlp
      CLOUD_PRC_HOST: PUT_YOUR_CLOUD_IP # e.g. 192.168.1.250
    volumes:
      - ~/.mytb-edge-data:/data
      - ~/.mytb-edge-logs:/var/log/tb-edge
```

Where:    
- `8080:8080` - connect local port 8080 to exposed internal HTTP port 8080
- `1883:1883` - connect local port 1883 to exposed internal MQTT port 1883  
- `5683:5683` - connect local port 5683 to exposed internal COAP port 5683   
- `mytb-edge-data:/data` - mounts the host's dir `mytb-edge-data` to ThingsBoard Edge DataBase data directory
- `mytb-edge-logs:/var/log/tb-edge` - mounts the host's dir `mytb-edge-logs` to ThingsBoard Edge logs directory
- `thingsboard/tb-edge` - docker image
- `CLOUD_ROUTING_KEY` - your edge key
- `CLOUD_ROUTING_SECRET` - your edge secret
- `CLOUD_PRC_HOST` - ip address of the machine with the ThingsBoard platform. 

**NOTE**: do not use *'localhost'* - *'localhost'* is the ip address of the edge service in the docker container 

- `restart: always` - automatically start ThingsBoard Edge in case of system reboot and restart in case of failure

Before starting Docker container run following commands to create a directory for storing data and logs and then change its owner to docker container user, to be able to change user, chown command is used, which requires sudo permissions (command will request password for a sudo access):
```
$ mkdir -p ~/.mytb-edge-data && sudo chown -R 799:799 ~/.mytb-edge-data
$ mkdir -p ~/.mytb-edge-logs && sudo chown -R 799:799 ~/.mytb-edge-logs
```

**NOTE**: Replace directory **~/.mytb-edge-data** and **~/.mytb-edge-logs** with directories youâ€™re planning to use in **docker-compose.yml**.

Set the terminal in the directory which contains the `docker-compose.yml` file and execute the following command to up this docker compose directly:

```
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up
```

After executing this command you can open `http://{your-host-ip}:8080` in you browser (for ex. `http://localhost:8080`). 
You should see ThingsBoard Edge login page.

Please use **tenant administrator** credentials to login to ThingsBoard Edge UI in case Edge connected to **ThingsBoard CE**.

If ThingBoard Edge connected to **ThingsBoard PE** please use credentials of the **user(s)** that were assigned to the Edge during Edge **provisioning**.

## Detaching, stop and start commands

You can detach from session terminal with `Ctrl-p` `Ctrl-q` - the container will keep running in the background.

In case of any issues you can examine service logs for errors. For example to see ThingsBoard Edge node logs execute the following command:
```
docker-compose logs -f mytbedge
```
To stop the container:
```
docker-compose stop
```
To start the container:
```
docker-compose start
```

## Troubleshootings

**Note** If you observe errors related to DNS issues, for example

```bash
127.0.1.1:53: cannot unmarshal DNS message
```

You may configure your system to use Google public DNS servers.
